# ISB Audio - Multilingual audio recordings of Indigenous Storybooks stories

This repo contains open-licensed audio recordings of stories from the [Indigenous Storybooks](https://indigenousstorybooks.ca) website read in Indigenous languages as well as English and French.

The original text of the stories in different languages can be found in the [ISB Source](https://github.com/global-asp/isb-source) repo.

## Languages

The audio for each language can be found in a folder labelled with the corresponding language code. A list of included languages and their language codes is below. The final column lists the name of the reader who recorded each language.

As the project is under active development, new languages and stories will be added in future updates.

## License

The audio in this project is released under the same open license (CC BY-NC-SA) as the original stories and their translations.

We are indebted to Little Cree Books for providing the original text of these stories in English, Plains Cree, and Swampy Cree.
